            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Comparing the top Smart contract platforms</h2>
            <h3>What are smart contracting platforms?</h3>
            <p>
                Smart contract platforms, unironically, provide a venue for deploying smart contracts and decentralized
                applications. They are owned,
                operated, and secured by distributed bases of token holders and
                computer hardware operators which makes them difficult to censor
                and provides for their 24/7 operation. They serve as the base security layer of this emerging
                “decentralized economy stack”. And everything that is built on top of them inherits their security,
                performance, and censorship-resistance characteristics.</p>
            <p>Let's look at some of the key metrics and fundamentals that investors and developer's consider while
                evaluating the Layer 1 landscape? </p>

            <h3 id="1">1.Market Cap</h3>
            <p>Market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins that have been mined by the price of a
                single coin at any given time.<br>
                One way to think about market cap is as a rough gauge for how stable an asset is likely to be. (It’s
                important to note that even Bitcoin, crypto’s biggest market cap, still sees volatility.) But the same
                way a bigger ship can safely navigate heavy weather, a cryptocurrency with a much larger market cap is
                more likely to be a more stable investment than one with a much smaller market cap. Conversely digital
                currencies with smaller market caps are more susceptible to the whims of the market – and can see huge
                gains or dramatic losses in their wake. <br>
                1. Large-cap Market cap more than $10 billion<br>
                2. Mid-cap market cap between $1billion to $10 billion<br>
                3. Small-cap market cap of less than $1 billion<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Problems with this mertic</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The biggest problem with using market capitalization as a measure of how strong a particular
                        cryptocurrency is that there are many
                        situations where units of the cryptocurrency are not in liquid circulation.
                        These locked up or lost cryptocurrency units can affect what the real market cap is of any
                        cryptocurrency.
                        When you’re looking at Bitcoin market cap, for example, it’s important to take into
                        consideration that somewhere around 4 million Bitcoins are lost on servers somewhere. That’s
                        according to a study from Chainalysis.
                        So, when you look at standard market cap valuation of how much each Bitcoin is worth times how
                        many Bitcoins there are, you really should take out the “missing” Bitcoin to see how much the
                        company is actually worth.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Market cap is about price, not value. It does not reflect the value of the company or crypto
                        asset you’re investing in. This is a fundamental distinction that is often overlooked. Price is
                        what you pay for a coin or token, it has nothing to do with what you actually get aka value.
                        It’s an indication of what people are paying for something, and this is usually driven by
                        irrational sentiment, which has little connection to an asset’s real value. Assuming that
                        whatever the market is willing to charge for an asset is equal to what it’s worth is a big
                        mistake.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <h4>Native Token Distribution</h4>
            <p>Tokens are generally created in initial sales to either venture capital
                firms or, in some cases, the general public to raise funds to support
                development. Additionally, there are several other categories for which
                token supply is typically “earmarked” at the token creation event:<br>
                i. Staking Rewards / Incentives represent tokens slated to be paid
                out to validators and delegators or emitted in airdrops.<br>
                ii. Foundation / Ecosystem Support tokens are typically reserved for
                building out infrastructure, securing strategic partnerships, and
                supporting projects that are looking to deploy apps on these networks.<br>
                iii. Development Organization and Team tokens incentivize developers tasked with developing core<br>
                platform technology and conducting ongoing research<br>
                Native token value has a unique relationship with platform security; especially when it comes to PoS
                networks. In PoS networks, the aggregate value of staked tokens serves as a proxy for how costly it can
                be to attack the network. Networks with native tokens that are more valuable, more widely distributed,
                and more commonly used for staking are more difficult to attack. All else equal, higher attack
                difficulty makes platforms more attractive venues for deploying applications which could, in turn, drive
                more usage and incremental token value. Hence, native token value and platform security are intertwined
                and there is a potential for positive feedback loops. The opposite effect is also true. If a native
                token has little to no value, its platform provides weak censorship resistance and security guarantees.
                And it will most likely not be an attractive venue for deploying applications that could drive
                incremental token value.</p>

            <br>
            <h3 id="2">2.Security</h3>
            <p>Security should always be top priority when evaluating any Layer 1.<br>
                At the core, blockchains are settlement layers for value. If the settlement layer isn’t secure, it’s not
                worth anything. You need assurances that when you transact on the network that your transaction is
                final. There should be no chance of reversibility from bad actors. </p>
            <h4>Attack vector 1: 33% attack</h4>
            <p>
                How much does it cost for an entity to become 33% validator?<br>
                PoS networks reach an agreement and transactions are finalized when 2/3 or 66% of the aggregate
                financial
                stake in the network agrees that a block or a series of blocks are final. 33% is generally only enough
                to
                halt the chain so it can't come to consensus and produce new blocks, not to actually perform a double
                spend.
                For that you'd need a whopping 66%. So, the blockchains with high Staking amount are secure. The amount
                staked in different blockchains is showed below.</p>
            <div class="iframeContainer">

                <iframe src="https://www.stakingrewards.com/staking/?sort=totalValueLocked_DESC" scrolling="no"

            </div>
            <br>
            <h3 id="3">3.Demand for block space</h3>
            <h4>How much people value using layer1==fee paid.</h4>
            <p>Let's understand why this is important, all the blockchains have limited number of transition that they
                can
                make ,one's the limit is hint the user's have to pay higher fee so that the validator include there
                transaction in the block. So fee paid is directly link to demand for blockchain.</p>
            <div class="feebox"><iframe class="fee" src="https://cryptofees.info/" srcolling="no"></iframe></div>
            <h3 id="4">4.Profit ability of blockchain</h3>
            <h4>Profit=Total Revenue - Total Expenses<br>
                Total revenue is the transaction fee paid to validators<br>
                Total expenses is the issuance of native token to validators<br>
                Profit=Transaction fee - Token issuance</h4>
            <p>If a blockchain is paying more for security than the revenue they bring in, they're running a deficit.
                Which means the coin holders are paying for the security. As result the coin holder are losing the value
                because of issuance.<br>
                Across the board, blockchain networks today are spending more on security costs than they’re bringing in
                revenue.
                This is okay – the ecosystem is young. There’s a lot of development that needs to be done. There are a
                lot more people to onboard into this technology.<br>
                The first profitable blockchain will be Ethereum after the post merge.</p>

            <h3 id="5">5.Are there developers</h3>
            <p>Without developers, there are no applications.<br>
                Without applications, there are no users.<br>
                No users = no value.<br>
                As a result, a robust developer ecosystem is essential for the success of a Layer1 . Developers build
                killer apps that attract end-user to the platform. Which in turn attract more developer to the platform.
                Fortunately, Electric Capital does a great job every year diving into the developer ecosystem across
                different networks.</p>

            <h3 id="6">6.Decentralization</h3>
            <p>Decentralization should
                be a persistent and mission-critical goal for
                communities building blockchain infrastructure.
                It is how security and censorship resistance are
                achieved and it has far-reaching consequences
                for entire ecosystems.</p>
            <h5>i. The computational requirements to run a validator node</h5>
            <p> While PoS networks are substantially less computationally intensive than their PoW counterparts, they
                nonetheless require upfront and ongoing spend on computer infrastructure to run blockchain software.
                Depending on how networks are structured, requirements can vary substantially. They span inexpensive
                consumer-grade hardware such as Raspberry Pis and laptops that cost around $100 to $1,000 to
                industrial-grade hardware setups that cost thousands of dollars and require substantial recurring
                maintenance spend.</p>
            <img src="./images/Hardware-requirements.png">
            <h5>ii. The minimum financial stake required to enter the validator set.</h5>
            <p>In addition to procuring hardware to run blockchain software, validators in PoS networks are typically
                required to "lock-up" a minimum amount of financial stake to enter the validator set. As displayed in
                the table below, requirements vary substantially on a network-to-network basis.</p>
            <img src="./images/minimumStaking.png">
            <h5>iii. Staking Nodes Distribution</h5>
            <img src="./images/distrubtion.png">
            <h3 id="7">7.Performance</h3>
            <p>While consensus algorithms are a critical component of how networks operate, they also impact one of
                their most important attributes: performance. Performance is best measured through two metrics:
                throughput levels and finality. Throughput defines how many transactions a network can handle in a set
                amount of time and is typically measured in transactions per second (TPS). Finality defines how long a
                user typically needs to wait until there is a reasonable assurance that their transactions will not be
                rolled back</p>
            <img src="./images/performance.png">
            <h3 id="8">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>So, it up to you to decide which blockchain you value the most base on the different accepts presented.
