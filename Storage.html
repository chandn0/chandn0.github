            <h3>Strorage</h3>
            <p>Unlike a centralized server operated by a single company or organization, decentralized storage systems
                consist of a peer-to-peer network of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a
                resilient file storage sharing system. These can be in a blockchain-based application or any
                peer-to-peer-based network.

                Ethereum itself can be used as a decentralized storage system, and it is when it comes to code storage
                in
                all the smart contracts. However, when it comes to large amounts of data, that isn't what Ethereum was
                designed for. The chain is steadily growing, but at the time of writing, the Ethereum chain is around
                500GB
                - 1TB (depending on the client), and every node on the network needs to be able to store all of the
                data. If
                the chain were to expand to large amounts of data (say 5TBs) it wouldn't be feasible for all nodes to
                continue to run. Also, the cost of deploying this much data to Mainnet would be prohibitively expensive
                due
                to gas fees.

                Due to these constraints, we need a different chain or methodology to store large amounts of data in a
                decentralized way.</p>
